E-Commerce Sales Analysis
This project analyzes an E-Commerce sales dataset to derive meaningful insights and trends through data cleaning and visualization techniques. The project uses Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries to explore key business metrics such as sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

Key Libraries Used:
NumPy: For handling numerical computations and array manipulation efficiently.
Pandas: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling large datasets in a structured format.
Matplotlib: To create static, animated, and interactive visualizations for exploring sales data.
Seaborn: For producing high-level, attractive statistical graphics.

Conclusion:
Married women aged 26-35, particularly from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT or Healthcare, are key buyers, driving significant sales during the Diwali season, mainly in Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
These libraries helped in performing data cleaning, analysis, and generating visual insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the sales trends.
